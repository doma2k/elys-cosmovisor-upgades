# elys-cosmovisor-upgades

Need to be downloaded to elys folder and lunched from there.
Can be used with crontab
- comparing latest binary version to existing upgrades cosmovisor folder 
- if latest binary doesnt not exists it creates new cosmovisor folder and building new binary
!!! works only with latest upgrade if two or more upgrades missing , might not work !!!
